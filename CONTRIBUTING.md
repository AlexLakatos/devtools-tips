# Contributing to DevTools tips

## Adding a new tip

* Choose a unique ID for your new tip:
  * There shouldn't already be a file in `src/tips/en` with the name `<the-new-id>.md`
  * Make the ID human-readable, so it's easy to know what the tip is about without opening the md file
  * Use only lowercase characters and replace spaces with `-`
  * Since the ID is used for the name of the file, it's important that once it's chosen, it doesn't change. Otherwise we might lose commit history on tips and we use it to attribute authorship on tops pages.
* Create the md file:
  * Create a new file: `src/tips/en/<the-new-id>.md`
  * Add a front matter to the file with the following information:
    * `title`: A title for the tip
    * `tags`: A list of categories and browsers that correspond to this tip
      * Reuse existing categories (found in other tips, like `css`, `console`, etc.)
      * At the end of the list, insert the browsers that this tip works on, by adding a tag that starts with `browser:` followed by either `edge`, `firefox` or `chrome`
  * Add the content of the tip in the file, as markdown. Don't use headings, but feel free to format your content with italic, bold, bullet points, line breaks, etc.
  * Try to add an image as this helps user a lot. Please include only 1 image if possible, and please add alt text.
    * Place the image in `src/assets/img` and give it the same name as the tip md file: `<the-new-id>.png`
* Build the site locally to test that things work fine
* Open a pull request to get your new tip reviewed and checked-in

## Translating tips

_TODO_

## Building and testing the site locally

First make sure you have cloned the repo locally, then open a command line at the root of the repo.

* `npm init` to get all of the dependencies installed
* `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` to launch the build and start a local server
* Then open a browser and navigate to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)

The page should auto-reload as you make changes to source code.
