# [DevTools Tips](https://devtoolstips.org/)

A collection of nice and simple cross-browser tips and tricks to get you more comfortable and productive with using DevTools.

Browser vendors have DevTools reference documentation, it's great and you should totally go and read it, __but__ I feel like not many people actually do.\
It's often very long and touches on all of the features. It may be daunting for new web developers, or for developers who have only been using a few tools but haven't yet discovered other features.

DevTools is such a feature rich app that covers many different use cases and has many features. It doesn't really make sense for someone to read a reference doc from start to finish before starting using it.\
However, having short and specific articles about how to achieve certain things is useful.

I've seen people share tips on their blogs, at conferences and on twitter, and it's a great way to discover new things and raise awareness about other tools you might not be using.\
These are, however, often mono-browser and not always up to date.

My hope here is to create an open-source repository that people, anyone, DevTools developers and users, can hopefully contribute to and help maintain.
