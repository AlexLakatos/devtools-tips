Browser vendors depend on your feedback to build the right tools for you. Without hearing from you all about what problems you have, or what features you lack, they can't take the right decisions about what to build.

If you report bugs to the devtools team when you see them, you won't just be helping you when the fix comes, but you may be helping many others who have the same bug but haven't reported it.

It's worth knowing that the various devtools teams at Microsoft, Mozilla, Apple and Google are usually fairly small and receive a lot of feedback, so reporting an issue does not mean it will be fixed quickly (or at all, if it's lower priority than others), but it does help, and those teams **are listening**.

Here are a few ways you can report bugs, ask questions or request features:

* **Firefox DevTools**:
  * Firefox uses [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) as their public bug tracker and anyone is welcome to report bugs or ask for new features by creating a new entry on Bugzilla. All you need is a GitHub account to log in.
  * Getting in touch with the team can either be done on Twitter by mentioning the [@FirefoxDevTools](https://twitter.com/FirefoxDevTools) account, or logging in to [the Mozilla chat](https://chat.mozilla.org) (find documentation about the chat [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix)).
* **Safari Web Inspector**:
  * Like Firefox, Safari uses the Bugzilla product to track their [webkit bugs](https://bugs.webkit.org/). Here is documentation about how to [search for bugs and report new ones](https://webkit.org/reporting-bugs/).
  * You can also get in touch with the team on Twitter with [@webkit](https://twitter.com/webkit).
* **Edge DevTools**:
  * The easiest way to report a problem or ask for a feature is by using [the feedback button](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/#getting-in-touch-with-the-microsoft-edge-devtools-team) in DevTools (the little stick figure in the top-right corner of the tools)
  * Asking questions to the team works best over Twitter by mentioning the [@EdgeDevTools](https://twitter.com/EdgeDevTools) account.
* **Chrome DevTools**:
  * Chrome is based on the open-source Chromium project that uses Monorail as their bug tracker. You can [find all issues and create new ones here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list).
  * They also listen for feedback on [the devtools-dev mailing list](https://www.chromium.org/teams/devtools) as well as twitter on [@ChromeDevTools](https://twitter.com/ChromeDevTools).
