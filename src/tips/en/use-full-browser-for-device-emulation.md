Emulating different devices in the browser is incredibly useful. It gets tricky but when you are on a device with limited resolution as the emulated device needs to be zoomed down to fit the screen as a large part of the window is taken up by the Developer Tools.  

Firefox has a keyboard shortcut to show device emulation without Developer Tools - `CMD`+`option`+m on Mac and `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `M` on Windows/Linux.

On Chromium based browsers like Chrome and Edge the trick is to start the device emulation and then undock the Developer Tools. You can undock the tools into an own window using the `â€¦` menu. This gives you the full browser as an emulation playground.
