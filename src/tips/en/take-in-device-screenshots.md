Taking a photo of a mobile device or tablet is daunting as you have to deal with fingerprints, glare and focus issues. Using Device Emulation makes this a lot easier.

1. Open any web product in your Chromium browser and Open Developer Tools with `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`CMD+Shift+I` on Mac) or `F12`.

1. If there is a frame, you can see your web product inside it.
1. Go to the `More options` menu `…` once more and select `Capture screenshot`
