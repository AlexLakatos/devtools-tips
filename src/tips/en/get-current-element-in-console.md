If you selected an element in the Elements panel (in Chrome, Safari or Edge) or the Inspector panel (in Firefox), you can refer to it in the console using `$0`.

This shortcut will return the DOM node instance, which you can then use to do things like getting computed styles, or check DOM properties, etc.

Example: `getComputedStyles($0).display`.
