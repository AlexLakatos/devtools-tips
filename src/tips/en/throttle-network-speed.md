While you may develop your website on a fast network connection at home or at work, your users may not be able to use it with an equally fast connection. Perhaps they're in a moving car, or on the subway, or they don't have access to high-speed internet at their place. Whatever it is, they may experience your site very differently than you do because of this.

Testing your site with a slower connection helps you understand how it loads and appears on the screen.

Firefox, Chrome and Edge let you simulate slower network connections to do this. The procedure is the same in all of them:

* Go to the Network panel
* Use the dropdown that says `No throttling` and choose any of the other values.
