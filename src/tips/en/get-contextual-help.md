Edge has a feature called the __DevTools Tooltips__ that gives you help about the different tools right inside of DevTools.

There are several ways to enable it:

* press `ctrl+shift+H` (or `cmd+shift+H` on Mac),
* or click on the three-dots menu icon, then Help, then Toggle the DevTools Tooltips,
* or using the command menu (`ctrl+shift+P` or `cmd+shift+P`) and typing tooltips

When tooltips are enabled, you can hover over them to get documentation about the tools.
