If you want to use DevTools in another language than English, you can do it in Edge and Firefox.

In Firefox, DevTools will always match the language of the browser, so if you downloaded Firefox in French for instance, then DevTools will be in French too.

In Edge, you can choose between English and the language the browser is in. To do so, in Edge:
* Go to Settings.
* Go to Languages.
* Add the language of your choice and select "Display Microsoft Edge in this language".

And then in DevTools:
* Open the settings (press F1 or click the cog icon).
* Click the "Match browser language" checkbox.
