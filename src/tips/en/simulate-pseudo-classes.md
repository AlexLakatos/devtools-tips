If you use `:hover`, `:active`, and other such pseudo-classes in CSS, you can actually simulate these states in DevTools without having to hover over or click on buttons and links.

Open the Styles panel (in Chrome or Edge) or the Rules panel (in Firefox), and click the `:hov` button. This will expand a section that allows you to lock one or multiple of these pseudo-classes on the selected element.
