Do you find the UI of DevTools too small to comfortably work with? Because this UI is made of HTML and CSS, just like any other web pages, it can be zoomed in (or out) by the browser just like you can zoom in on web pages.

To zoom the UI of DevTools:

* Make sure it has focus first (click somewhere in DevTools).
* Use the `Ctrl +` and `Ctrl -` keyboard shortcuts to zoom in or out (replace `Ctrl` with `Cmd` on Mac).
