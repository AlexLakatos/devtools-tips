See your page in 3 dimensions to quickly find out how deeply nested it is and fix z-index stacking issues.

* In Edge, open the command menu (`ctrl+shift+P` or `cmd+shift+P`).
* Type `3D` and press Enter.
* In the new panel that opens, switch between the 2 z-index and DOM modes to visualize the page in 3D.
